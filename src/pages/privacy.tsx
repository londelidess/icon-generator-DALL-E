            described information that can identify individuals. Information
            other than personal information corresponds to history and
            characteristic information, such as services used, products
            purchased, history of pages/ads viewed, search keywords used by
            users, time and date of use, methods of using, using environment,

              We will not provide privacy information to third parties without
              the prior approval of users, except in the following
              circumstances. However, this does not apply to cases where
              provision is permitted under the Act on the Protection of Personal

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>A)</strong> Where requested under laws and regulations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>B)</strong> Where the provision is necessary for
                protecting human life, body, or property, and it is difficult to
                obtain consent from the user.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>C)</strong> Where it is particularly necessary for
                improving public health or promoting the sound growth of
                children, and it is difficult to obtain consent from the user.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>D)</strong> Where it is necessary to assist a national
                organization, a local public organization, or an entrusted party
                in performing tasks prescribed by law, and obtaining consent
                from the user could impede the execution of these tasks.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In addition, if we outsource all or part of the handling of
              privacy information to achieve the purposes of use, or if privacy
              information is provided as part of a business succession due to
              merger or other reasons, this will not be considered as providing
              privacy information to a third party.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may also share or disclose privacy information at the
              user&quot;s request if a user links any of our services with
              external services.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">User Rights</h2>
            <p>
              If a user himself/herself requests the disclosure of their privacy
              information, we will disclose it without delay, unless disclosure
              could harm the life, body, property, or other interests of the
              user or a third party, significantly hinder the proper performance
              of our business, or violate laws and regulations. In cases where
              we decide not to disclose information, we will inform the user
              without delay. A fee of 1000 yen will be charged for each instance
              of disclosure.
            </p>

            <p>
              If any user&quot;s personal information we own is incorrect, the
              user can request us to correct or delete the personal information
              by the procedure stipulated by us. Upon such a request, and if we
              judge it necessary to meet the request, we will correct or delete
              the personal information and inform the user without delay.
            </p>

            <p>
              When a user requests discontinuation of the use of his/her privacy
              information, claiming that the information is handled beyond the
              scope of the purposes of use or was obtained by unjust means, we
              will conduct a necessary investigation. Based on the outcome, we
              may take measures such as discontinuing the use, and will inform
              the user without delay. However, if discontinuing the use of
              privacy information involves an inordinate expense or is
              difficult, and alternative measures are possible to protect the
              rights and benefits of the users, we will take such alternative
              measures instead.
