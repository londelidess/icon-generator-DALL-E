## Lessons Learned

Given the project's reliance on an open-API for image generation, data efficiency was a prime focus. Here are the major insights:

### 1. Image Storing: Base64 Encoding:

- **Resilience**: Base64 ensures consistent image access, regardless of the original source URL's status.
  
- **Embeddability**: Base64 images can be directly incorporated into web assets, optimizing HTTP requests albeit with a slight increase in data size.

### 2. Image Rendering: Advantages of Next.js's `Image`:

- **Optimal Formats**: The component automatically selects efficient formats like WebP when supported, optimizing file sizes.

- **Adaptability**: It adjusts in response to varying devices or viewports, ensuring efficient data usage.

- **Performance**: Features like lazy loading boost page load speed and enhance the overall user experience.

### 3. Performance Enhancements with Pagination:

- **Efficient Content Delivery**: Implementing pagination provided a streamlined method to manage and display a large set of icons. By delivering content in manageable chunks, user experience was improved with quicker load times and reduced initial page load burden.
