## Lessons Learned

Given the project's reliance on an open-API for image generation, data efficiency was a prime focus. Here are the major insights:

### 1. Image Storing: Base64 Encoding:

- **Resilience**: Base64 ensures consistent image access, regardless of source URL status.
  
- **Embeddability**: Base64 images can be directly incorporated into web assets, optimizing HTTP requests at the slight expense of increased data size.

### 2. Image Rendering: Advantages of Next.js's `Image`:

- **Optimal Formats**: The component selects efficient formats like WebP when supported, optimizing file sizes.

- **Adaptability**: It responds to varying devices or viewports, ensuring efficient data usage.

- **Performance**: Features like lazy loading enhances load speed and overall user experience.
